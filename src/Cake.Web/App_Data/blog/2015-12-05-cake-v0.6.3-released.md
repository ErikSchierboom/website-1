Version 0.6.3 of Cake has been released.

We have just released version 0.6.3 of Cake.  This is a hotfix release to correct two main issues that were identified when using spaces in paths for both NuGet and MSBuild.  Thanks to [@SharpeRAD](https://github.com/SharpeRAD) for their contribution here.

In this release, we also took the opportunity to include initial support for DNU.  This contribution was gratefully received from [@jorisdebock](https://github.com/jorisdebock). 

Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.
