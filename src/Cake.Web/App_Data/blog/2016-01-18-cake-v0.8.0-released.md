Version 0.8.0 of Cake has been released.

In this release we've added support for making the `#tool` and `#addin` directives independent from a specific package manager, as well as adding support for fetching specific and prerelease versions of NuGet packages.

To make this possible we've introduced a URI package format that will allow us to expand the package managment experience in the future. The old syntax for referencing packages is still supported, but will be limited to NuGet only.

```csharp
// Syntax of new URI package format:
// packagemanager:[scheme:[//[user:password@]host[:port]][/]]?package=id[&query]

// Examples of how to use the tool directive.
#tool nuget:?package=ILMerge&version=2.14.1203

// Example of how to use the addin directive.
#addin nuget:http://mysource.org/?package=Cake.Foo&version=1.2.3&prerelease
```

In addition to the changes to the addin and tool directive, we also added functionality to support [GitLink](https://github.com/GitTools/GitLink) and XmlPeek aliases.  See the linked issues below for more information on these features.

Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.
