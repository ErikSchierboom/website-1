Version 0.6.4 of Cake has been released.

We have just released version 0.6.4 of Cake.  This is a hotfix release to correct an issue when building projects on Mono.

This problem was introduced as a direct result of changes made in our 0.6.3 release, and we apologise for any problems that this has caused you.

The Cake Team are actively looking into ways in way we can setup and execute multiple sets of integration tests, which will run on Windows, Linux and Mac, in order to prevent these types of regression from happening again. 

Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.
